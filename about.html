      <div class="about-intro-body">
        <div class="about-intro-text">
          <p>Starting with a foundation in industrial design and marketing, I've worked across multiple disciplines: advertising, education, consultancy, and customer success.</p>
          <p>Why Holisk? The name reflects a core principle that has guided my career: a deep curiosity not just for how things work, but for how they can work better. My background in product design taught me the value of approaching challenges holistically—understanding the broader context, identifying root causes, and designing solutions that are both effective and sustainable. This mindset has helped me ensure that every solution is informed by a full view of the system it operates within.</p>
          <p>Whether it's identifying friction in customer journeys, designing more efficient systems, or advising clients on scalable strategies, I approach each challenge with structured creativity—breaking down issues, mapping stakeholder needs, and crafting solutions that are both technically sound and strategically aligned. This wide-ranging experience has sharpened my ability to see across disciplines and identify patterns that lead to meaningful, sustainable outcomes. This is exactly where visibility, feasibility and desirability meet.</p>

          The Triad
        </h2>

        <p>At the core of my professional path is a belief in the transformative synergy of these three disciplines. I see design as the engine that understands people, technology as the platform that enables solutions, and business as the structure that sustains them. When these three forces are aligned, they empower companies to create truly meaningful solutions—ones that scale impact, elevate customer experience, and drive sustainable growth. That is true innovation.</p>
        <p>My transition into full-stack development is a natural extension of this triad. By gaining deeper technical skills, I aim to better connect strategic thinking with technical execution, bridging the gap between concept. Whether working on customer experience strategy or complex technical projects, I always return to the intersection of business needs, technological possibilities, and user realities.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, my goal is to help shape products and strategies that make a meaningful difference. I believe that innovation isn't just about being cutting-edge—it's about being relevant, valuable, and inclusive. When business, technology, and innovation move together, they don't just solve problems—they create entirely new possibilities.</p>

              <h4>Design</h4>
              <p>Design is the bridge between human needs and purposeful solutions. It brings empathy into the innovation process by focusing on how people interact with products, services, and systems.</p>
              <p>Through a thoughtful, iterative approach, design uncovers insights, shapes user experiences, and drives the creation of solutions that are not only functional but also intuitive and meaningful.</p>

              <p>Technology is the engine of possibility. It empowers us to scale ideas, automate complexity, and unlock new forms of interaction and value creation.</p>
              <p>When guided by design and anchored in business objectives, technology enables bold experimentation, continuous improvement, and the building of systems that adapt to a changing world.</p>
