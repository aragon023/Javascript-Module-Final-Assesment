          </div>
          <p class="project-description">
            The historical Italian Design Factory Alessi invited international creatives to rethink their product as an act of love. The aim was to interpret the love token in a contemporary way, designing a new object that celebrated this universal feeling. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Pluma wanted to create an emotional bond between two people by connecting them with the most essential part of them...their language.
            The project was inspired by the old quill, a tool that has been used for centuries to write letters and poems.
            In a time when technology has put aside tradition, being inspired in the old quill idea brought a sense of nostalgia and reinforced the message of a deep connection.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pluma was selected as one of the ten award winners from a pool of 1,186 international participants.

            <span class="tag">Graphic Design</span>
          </div>
          <p class="project-description">
            Jack Daniel's, the iconic Tennessee whiskey brand, invited creatives to design a poster that would promote responsible drinking while celebrating the brand's rich heritage.
            <br>
            <br>
            The poster won two competitions - Best Design in the Idearama Design Competition in 2013 and Silver in the Eucol Mupi National Awards in 2014
            <br>
            <br>
            The design features a guitar coming out of a bottle, which is a symbol of the brand's connection to music and rock culture.
            It was done using a combination of modeling and rendering in 3D Studio Max + Vray and digital illustration techniques in Photoshop, creating a visually striking and memorable piece that captures the essence of Jack Daniel's.

          <p class="project-description">
          The Dance and Choreography Center of Valle del Cauca, LA LICORERA, is a space for national and international connection that positions the city of Cali and the Valle del Cauca as an epicenter of dance. 
          <br>
          It is imagined as place for creation and dialogue across genres, generations, and forms of knowledge, all coming together to envision the future of Colombian dance, faithful to its roots, its past and present, with a forward-looking perspective.
          <br>
          The old warehouses from the Industria de Licores (regional distillery) serves as the main location for the venue. 
          <br>
          The whole complex repurposed a series of six buildings: a multipurpose exhibition and showroom warehouse, a dance and training building, a multifunctional theatre with a seating capacity of 700 , a housing complex for artists, a restaurant and a regional dance museum.
